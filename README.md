# SkipYouTubeTalkers
Under construction.
This is not working as of now.

It would be a Chrome extension which would auto-skip when the video displaying area is entirely occupied by a face which seems like talking to their audience.

Tasks -
- Does YouTube allow programatic skipping?
- Detecting a talking face -
  - Detecting video duration with a talking face.
  - Detecting frames?
- Define Talking face.
- Object detection in video, applying on web/Chrome extension.
